        * generic/*: Updated TileQt to the latest tile. Eliminated the source of
        some XErrors caused by Qt progress widgets. Made the whole tileQt
        thread-safe. Finally, a problem has been found regarding the use of rw
        QComboBox widgets: wish may crash on exit, if such a widget is allocated
        (and freed) at least once. This however, seems to happen only with Tk
        8.5, so its in the code for the time being...

        * generic/tileQt_QApp.cpp: Added Tk_DeleteGenericHandler for TileQt_smw
        widget before deleting it in TileQt_DestroyQApp, to avoid crashes during
        application termination.

	* configure.in, Makefile.in, pkgIndex.tcl.in: Generate 
	pkgIndex.tcl at configure-time instead of build-time.
	Change pkgIndex.tcl to register ifneeded script for package 
	"tile::theme::tileqt", instead of "tileqt", so it shows
	up in the list of available themes.
	* Makefile.in, configure.in: Replaced automake-legacy 'install' targets.
	Other misc. cleanup.
	* configure: Regenerated

	* generic/*.cpp
        * generic/*.h: Updated to the new Ttk_* API.
        
        * tclconfig/kde-qt.m4: Additions to autoconf macros to locate
        KDE/QT needed files. (Actually, macros from KDEBASE package were
        imported; used under the LGPL license.)
