        * generic/tileQt_Combobox.cpp: Fixed a bug in combotext_statemap, for
        the TTK_STATE_PRESSED state.

        * generic/tileQt_Utilities.h: Added new definition for drawing
        * generic/tileQt_Entry.cpp:   background with the base colour (used for
        entry widgets) - TILEQT_PAINT_BACKGROUND_BASE. Now, the entry widget use
        this macro for drawing its background. Bug reported by Csaba Nemethi.

        * ================= Release 0.4 beta 1 =================
        * generic/tileQt_Paned.cpp:      Added support for the paned, separator,
        * generic/tileQt_Separator.cpp:  and sizegrip widgets. However, the
        * generic/tileQt_SizeGrip.cpp:   separator support is disabled, as only
        a couple of Qt styles support PE_Separator, and it will be removed in
        Qt 4 (already renamed to PE_Q3Separator). Qt does not have a separator
        widget: separators are emulated through QFrame widgets, with a frame
        type of H/VLine. Not easy to support...

        * generic/tileQtNotebook.cpp: Various improvements in how tabs are
        drawn. 

        * library/tileqt.tcl: Changed updateStyles to use the new getPixelMetric
        command, to set a proper style for notebook tabs. Now, updateStyles
        declares the -tabmargins option in the TNotebook and -expand in the
        TNotebook.Tab styles. Many thanks to Joe English for explaining what
        these options do and how can be used...

        * generic/tileQt_Init.c: Added a new function (Tileqt_GetPixelMetric)
        and a new Tcl command (tile::theme::tileqt::getPixelMetric).

2006-15-08  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * generic/tileQt_Button.cpp:
        * generic/tileQtNotebook.cpp: Use TileQt_QtStateInfo instead of
        Ttk_StateTableLookup. Changes in TButton layout to support a focus ring.
        (Bug reported by Mark Garvey <Mark.Garvey@bruker-biospin.de>)

        * generic/tileQt_Utilities.h:
        * generic/tileQt_Utilities.cpp: Added functions TileQt_QtStateInfo &
        TileQt_StateTableLookup (as a custom Ttk_StateTableLookup). Also, fixed
        TileQt_StateInfo to print all states, and not just one.

        * generic/*.cpp: I have misanderstood the way
        Ttk_StateTableLookup works, and probably this is the main reason for 
        missing some effects on some widgets. This originated from discussions
        with Mark Garvey <Mark.Garvey@bruker-biospin.de>, where buttons didn't
        show a ring when they had focus.

2006-27-06  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * generic/*.cpp: Completed port to Qt 4.x. Unfortunatelly, due to some
        Qt bugs, scrollbars, notebooks and sliders are not functional yet under
        Qt 4.x, although the drawing code is correct and mimics the Qt 3.x
        drawing code.
        
2006-22-06  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * library/tileqt.tcl: Changed padding for TCombobox, after suggestion by
        Csaba Nemethi.

2006-12-06  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * generic/tileQt_QtHeaders.h:
        * generic/tileQt_Utilities.h:
        * generic/tileQt_Utilities.cpp:
        * generic/tkMacros.h:
        * generic/tileQt_QApp.cpp:
        * generic/tileQt_Init.c:
        * generic/tileQt_Background.cpp:
        * generic/tileQt_Button.cpp:
        * generic/tileQt_CheckButton.cpp:
        * generic/tileQt_RadioButton.cpp: Initial support for Qt 4.x.
        Now, button, checkbutton & radiobutton can be compiled to use either
        Qt 3.x or Qt 4.x for drawing.
        
        * library/tileqt.tcl: Changed padding for TCombobox & TEntry. Bug
        reported by Csaba Nemethi.
        
2006-04-06  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * tcl-config: Added support for finding Qt 4.x.
        
        * generic/tileQt_CheckButton.cpp:
        * generic/tileQt_RadioButton.cpp: Only the size of indicators is now
        retrieved from Qt, and not the whole widget size (as before). This
        change was a request from Mats Bengtsson, as check/radio buttons appear
        to be taller that with other tile themes.
        
2006-18-05  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * generic/tileQt_Init.c: Fixed a crash in Tileqt_ThemeColour, when
        invoked with no arguments.
        
2006-13-05  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * generic/tileQt_Init.c: Added a new command for changing the used
        colour palette from Tk (setPalette).

        * library/tileqt.tcl: Added functions kdeLocate_kdeglobals,
        kdePaletteChangeNotification, kdeGetColourHex, which get called during
        colour palette changes from the KDE KIPC.

2006-30-04  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * generic/tileQt_QApp.cpp: Added support for KDE color palette changes.

        * library/tileqt.tcl: Fixed a bug in the style change dialog, reported
        by Csaba Nemethi.

        * tclconfig:
        * aclocal.m4: Updated extension configuration to TEA 3.5.

2006-26-03  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * ================= Release 0.3 =================
        
        * library/tileqt.tcl:
        * generic/tileQtScrollbar.cpp: Many changes regarding Keramik & other
        Qt styles (Motif, CDE, etc). Many of these changes originated from
        discussions witn Csaba Nemethi.
        
2006-20-03  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * generic/tileQtNotebook.cpp: Various aisthetic changes regarding
        notebook widgets. Now, tab bar base is drawn, if supported by the style.

        * library/tileqt.tcl: Various improvements regarding colours in disabled
        widget states.
        
        * generic/*: Changes for allowing a different Qt/KDE style to be used
        per interpreter.
        
2006-07-03  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * generic/tileQt_Init.c: Changed callback of
        tile::theme::tileqt::currentThemeColour, to give full colour
        introspection of the current theme.
        
2006-26-02  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * generic/*: Updated TileQt to the latest tile. Eliminated the source of
        some XErrors caused by Qt progress widgets. Made the whole tileQt
        thread-safe. Finally, a problem has been found regarding the use of rw
        QComboBox widgets: wish may crash on exit, if such a widget is allocated
        (and freed) at least once. This however, seems to happen only with Tk
        8.5, so its in the code for the time being...
        
2006-25-02  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * generic/tileQt_QApp.cpp: Added Tk_DeleteGenericHandler for TileQt_smw
        widget before deleting it in TileQt_DestroyQApp, to avoid crashes during
        application termination.

2005-01-08  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>
	* configure.in, Makefile.in, pkgIndex.tcl.in: Generate 
	pkgIndex.tcl at configure-time instead of build-time.
	Change pkgIndex.tcl to register ifneeded script for package 
	"tile::theme::tileqt", instead of "tileqt", so it shows
	up in the list of available themes.
	* Makefile.in, configure.in: Replaced automake-legacy 'install' targets.
	Other misc. cleanup.
	* configure: Regenerated

2004-11-10  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>

	* generic/*.cpp
        * generic/*.h: Updated to the new Ttk_* API.
        
        * tclconfig/kde-qt.m4: Additions to autoconf macros to locate
        KDE/QT needed files. (Actually, macros from KDEBASE package were
        imported; used under the LGPL license.)
